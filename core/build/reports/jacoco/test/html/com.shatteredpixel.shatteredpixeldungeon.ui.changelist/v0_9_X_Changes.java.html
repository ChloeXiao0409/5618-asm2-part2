				&quot;_-_ Released June 7th, 2021\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 101 days after Shattered v0.9.2\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.9.3 was the largest talent addition yet, with over 50 total talents and 9 new armor abilities! Armor abilities were another thing that I always intended to work with the talent system. They now fit in as a bit of an equivalent to subclasses with their own customization options both from talents and the abilities themselves. These talents also heavily impact the power of their respective armor abilities, meaning that the same ability can be quite different depending on which talents you choose to upgrade.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;This update also included Shattered's second new challenge! Badder bosses was rattling around in my head ever since the release of v0.8.0, as I knew it would be very easy to make stronger versions of each of the new boss encounters that weren't just based on higher stats. Badder bosses was well received while still managing to be distinct from hostile champions. Hostile champions is a bit more random and can apply anywhere, whereas badder bosses is consistent in its effect but only applies during specific fights.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L75">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.CROWN, null), &quot;Armor abilities and T4 Talents!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_Hero armor abilities have been totally overhauled, featuring 13 abilities and 40 T4 talents!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;After the defeating the fourth boss, the player now gets to choose between one of three abilities for each hero. Armor abilities also charge much faster, and can be further improved via tier four talents!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Each armor ability has three talents, plus one charge-speed talent that's shared between them. These talents all take up to 4 points, and there are up to 10 points available in tier 4, for levels 21-30.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L80">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.CHALLENGE_COLOR), &quot;New Challenge!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;A new challenge has been added: _Badder Bosses!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;This challenge is a followup to Hostile Champions in a lot of ways, making the dungeon's bosses much stronger, instead of the enemies. Early bosses like Goo are only a touch tougher, but lategame bosses are quite a lot more deadly!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;To go along with this challenge, I've also made a few targeted tweaks to regular boss mechanics:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Goo's_ pump up attack is now easier to dodge around terrain and doesn't highlight cells that Goo can't attack.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Regeneration in _Goo's_ boss fight now can't be farmed indefinitely by letting Goo heal.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Tengu_ can now throw bombs at his own feet.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Yog's_ fists now seek the hero out when they're wandering.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Yog's_ fists are now immune to sleeping effects.&quot;));

				&quot;I'm making some slight tweaks to level sizes and layouts, to make the game overall a little shorter, and to put a bit more emphasis on the final region:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Standard room count down by roughly 10/20/15/15/5%, for each region\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Connection room frequency down by ~25%\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Overall levels should now be a little smaller than they were before v0.9.1.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I'm also fixing a couple levelgen oddities while I'm here:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Entrance and Exit rooms now cannot directly connect to each other.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Reduced chance for 3+ enemies to appear near each other on floor 1.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Increased the minimum size of pit rooms, to prevent wraith fights in 3x3 spaces.&quot; ));

				&quot;_-_ All heroes now start with a velvet pouch. This should make sewers inventory management a bit smoother.\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ The _Dew Vial_ has been replaced with a _waterskin_. The waterskin has the same functionality, and all heroes start with one.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The _Tome of Mastery_ has been replaced by _Tengu's Mask_. The mask has the same functionality, but fits better thematically.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The _Armor Kit_ has been replaced by _Dwarf King's Crown_. The crown has the same functionality, but fits better thematically.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Interface Changes:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Overhauled the hero info window, and added a button for it in the ingame hero menu.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Overhauled the subclass selection interface, now much more informative.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Released February 26th, 2021\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 78 days after Shattered v0.9.1\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.9.2 added the first tier of talents that were applicable through the later stages of the game. This is where the talent system really started to feel like it was deepening existing character customization systems in the game, rather than being tacked on top of them. It was always my intention for talents to work with subclasses as well, as there were lots of little subclass-level effects that could be fun but couldn't fit into their own full subclass. Talents give these mechanics a place to exist that compliments the game's existing systems.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;These talent additions also gave me balance room to give some help to weaker enemies and also better balance the various subclasses. Subclasses that were already a bit strong got some of their innate powers moved to talents, wheras other subclasses got entirely new effects via the talent system. The Gladiator and freerunner in particular got more wide-reaching changes for both balance and design reasons.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L240">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.TALENT), &quot;Tier Three Talents!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_32 new talents have been added that span levels 13 to 20!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;These talents are a bit different than the previous tiers. They require 3 points each, are balanced to encourage specialization, and vary based on class and subclass!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;There is one more tier of talents left to be implemented, currently slated for v0.9.3. This tier will span levels 21-30, and will interact with an existing mechanic...&quot;));

				&quot;I've made a variety of changes to _the Gladiator_ to make combo moves more interesting, flexible, and easier to build to:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Combo is no longer reset on 2 misses, but misses also no longer reset combo time.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Combo time increased to 5 turns from 4.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Combo moves can now be selected, instead of only the strongest one being available.\n&quot; +

				&quot;I've redesigned _the Freerunner_'s main benefit to make it require more thought and give more visible power:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Freerunner still builds momentum by moving, but this does nothing on its own.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Freerunner can now activate momentum to start freerunning.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Freerunner has 2x movespeed and bonus evasion while freerunning.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Freerunning lasts for up to 20 turns, based on amount of momentum.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ There is a cooldown after freerunning before momentum can be build again.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ 68 days after Shattered v0.9.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.9.1 continued on the momentum of v0.9.0, adding a new tier of talents spanning the mid game. These talents were a lot more satisfying for players to use, as they were able to more significantly shape gameplay when compared to the early game talents added in v0.9.0.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I also became a lot more sure that I was making the right call by splitting the talent system into multiple updates. v0.9.1 was released quickly, more than doubled the number of talents, and made a bunch of crucial improvements to the talents added in v0.9.0. Had I released the entire system in one go then these sorts of growing pains would have stuck around for much longer.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.9.1 also includes the first major changes to level generation since v0.6.2! While the same base algorithms are still used to lay levels out, v0.9.1 made overall level structures more chaotic and varied, which really helped individual layouts feel more unique.&quot;));

				&quot;This is actually a bugfix, but I'm listing it separately for clarity. In v0.8.2 the _wand of frost_ is listed as losing 6.67% damage per turn of chill, to a max of -50%. This is not what was implemented however, and the wand instead lost 3.33% per turn to a max of -30%. This has now been corrected and the wand performs as listed in the 0.8.2 changelog.&quot;));
