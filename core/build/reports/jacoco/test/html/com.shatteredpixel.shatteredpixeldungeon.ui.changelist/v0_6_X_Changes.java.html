				&quot;_-_ Released May 3rd, 2018\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 32 days after Shattered v0.6.4\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.6.5 was the third major design iteration for glyphs, with the first being from Pixel Dungeon and the second from v0.4.0. In both of these earlier iterations glyphs had big trade-offs, which led many players to dislike or outright ignore them. I finally just decided to make them like enchantments. With that, plus the new augmentation functionality, armor finally had some of the variability in stats and effects that weapons had, though adding full blown armor types is still a common suggestion.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I also made another attempt at designing the Berserker in v0.6.5. Prior to this update his death-defying rage would always trigger if it was available. That built-in safety net translated to a win rate that was hugely higher than the other subclasses, so I decided to make building rage and cheating death much harder to access. The Berserker retained his simple up-front gameplay, but started requiring investment in armor and rage management to access his power.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L94">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new StoneOfAugmentation(),</span>
				&quot;The weightstone is now the runestone of augmentation!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Usability on weapons unchanged, can still be used to enhance either speed or damage at the cost of the other.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Can now be used on armor! Armor can be modified to enhance either defense or evasion, at the cost of the other.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Every shop now stocks a runestone of augmentation and an ankh, instead of one or the other.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L100">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.ARMOR_CLOTH, new Bulk().glowing()), &quot;New Curses&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Added 4 new curses:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Friendly curse makes weapons sometimes charm both you and the enemy.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Elastic curse lets weapons apply knockback, but reduces damage to 0.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Bulk curse makes armor large, slowing movement through doorways.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Overgrowth curse causes random plant effects when you are struck.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L107">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(BadgeBanner.image(Badges.Badge.CHAMPION_3.image), &quot;New and Changed Badges&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_-_ Added badges for winning with 3 challenges at once and 6 challenges at once.\n\n&quot; +

<span class="nc" id="L112">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new Image(Assets.Sprites.WARRIOR, 0, 90, 12, 15), &quot;Berserker&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Even with recent nerfs the berserker is still much stronger than other subclasses. Rather than continually nerfing his existing mechanics, which makes the subclass unfun, I have instead opted to give him a small rework.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;These changes focus on giving the berserker some of his old power back, but making it more difficult to access that power.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Rage is built by taking physical damage\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Rage fades over time, lasts longer at low HP\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Rage builds faster with better armor\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Rage grants bonus damage, max of +50%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Berserker now needs full rage to berserk\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Berserking no longer reduces max hp\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Berserk bonus shielding doubled\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Berserk bonus damage reduced to +50%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Removed exhaustion damage penalty\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Berserker can't gain rage while recovering&quot;));

				&quot;Glyphs were originally designed with the intention that taking no glyph should be a valid option. Now with augmenting armor, glyphs can be more about added bonuses, somewhat like enchantments. Several glyphs have been adjusted:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Entanglement now only roots if you stand still.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Potential no longer self-damages and grants charge more consistently.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Viscocity now always defers some damage, instead of sometimes deferring all damage.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Stone reworked. Now sets evasion to 0 and grants armor in proportion to evasion.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Swiftness reworked. Now grants movement speed when no enemies are near.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Viscocity is now a common glyph, Stone is now uncommon.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ 46 days after Shattered v0.6.3\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.6.4 was a smaller update, mostly focused on additions and fixes following v0.6.3. Probably the most interesting content that came in v0.6.4 was the crossbow! This weapon was an attempt to fulfill the common request for an ammo-based ranged weapon, without actually having an ammo system in the game. I felt that an ammo system would be more cumbersome than it would be worth. Letting darts piggyback on an equipped weapon seemed like a great compromise.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I also made some important changes to challenges in v0.6.4, primarily to make stacked challenge games a bit easier. This made high-challenge games more feasible without extreme luck, which led to a big increase in challenge interest among highly skilled players.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L221">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.CHALLENGE_COLOR), &quot;Challenges&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Challenges have received several major changes, with the goal of making them more fair and interesting.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Challenges now have descriptions\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ On diet now provides small rations, rather than removing all food\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Cloth armor is now allowed on faith is my armor\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Pharmacophobia is unchanged\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Barren land now allows seeds to drop, but they cannot be planted\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Swarm intelligence now draws nearby enemies, not all enemies\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Into darkness now limits light more harshly, but provides torches\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Forbidden runes now removes 50% of upgrade scrolls, and no other scrolls&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L234">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.INFO), &quot;Start game UI&quot;,</span>
				&quot;The interface for starting and loading a game has been completely overhauled!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Game now supports 4 save slots of any hero class, rather than 1 slot per class\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Hero select and challenge select are now more streamlined and informative\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Hero select is now a window, offering more flexibility of where games can be started\n&quot; +

<span class="nc" id="L242">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.CROSSBOW, null), &quot;New Weapons&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Three new weapons have been added!\n&quot; +

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The crossbow is a tier 4 melee weapon which enhances darts! You'll do less damage up-front, but thrown darts will pack a punch!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The gauntlet is a tier 5 fast melee weapon, similar to the sai. Excellent for chaining combos or enchantments.&quot;));

				&quot;\n&quot; +

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Prior to v0.6.3 thrown weapons broke on a single hit each and so weren't useful for much.

				&quot;v0.6.3 is also an excellent case for why I run betas for every Shattered update.

I ended up significantly reducing their stats and quantity before the full release.\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ 72 days after Shattered v0.6.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.6.1 was light on core game content, but made some critical improvements to the new player experience by expanding the journal system. I really wanted to make the player feel less compelled to seek out external guides for Shattered, and so I wrote up an in-game guide that pointed the player in the right direction without spoiling too much.  The previous system used signposts at the start of each floor, which were the same every run and couldn't be read at any time.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.6.1 also overhauled the changes screen, which you're viewing right now! Long text-based changelogs just don't work on mobile screens, as there's much less screen real-estate to work with. I didn't want Shattered's changelog to be a big wall of text, but I also didn't want to abbreviate lots of details. The solution was to keep the full text, but hide it behind categories and icons!&quot;));

				&quot;v0.6.0 was another major content change focused on the dungeon, this time to level generation!

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I'm really proud of this levelgen algorithm even to this day. v0.6.0 both improved levelgen on its own and paved the way for future improvements in updates like v0.6.2 and v0.9.1.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I feel v0.6.0 also represents the start of another era in Shattered's development. While Shattered was still missing some big updates (most notably v0.8.0), after v0.6.0 Shattered started to resemble its current incarnation more than the original Pixel Dungeon.&quot;));
