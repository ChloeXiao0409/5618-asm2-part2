				&quot;_-_ 81 days after Shattered v0.3.4\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.3.5 introduced the second proper class rework, this time to the Warrior! I tried to shift the warrior's powers away from a raw stat increase into something more interesting, while still keeping his power easy to access for new players. Similarly to the Mage's rework, the core ideas added here are still in the game, but I've since made lots of changes to the specifics.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;This was also the first time that I decided to split a major update into two smaller ones. Originally v0.4.0 was going to rework both the warrior and weapons, but part way through development I decided to split them in order to get an update out sooner. This approach was quite successful, but I ended up not properly using it again until v0.9.0!&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ 54 days after Shattered v0.3.3\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.3.4 made Shattered available in multiple languages! This update was a direct response to messages I kept getting from users who wanted to share the game with their friends, but couldn't due to the language barrier.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Translating the game was no small feat, Shattered has a huge amount of text that is constantly changing and growing, over 50 thousand words in total. Because of the volume of text it would have been prohibitively expensive to get the game professionally translated, and so I opted to ask for community translations instead.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The response from the community was and continues to be incredible! Even multiple years later Shattered's updates are still consistently translated into a number of languages.&quot;));

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.3.3 was a small bumper update that was mostly focused on getting Google Play Games functionality working.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Google Play Games was the first online functionality ever added to Shattered. Some people were worried that this was the start of me turning Shattered into a game that would require internet. I tried to address this worry by making the functionality as optional as possible and heavily emphasizing that it was only for tiny extras like cloud sync and play games badges. Nowadays things are much more relaxed and Shattered has several internet-enabled features, but still none of them are needed to play the game itself.&quot;));

				&quot;v0.3.2 was my second 'area rework' before I ended up shelving the idea. I stopped doing area reworks because I decided to shift my focus toward the longer-term, and so decided I wanted to make other changes before reworking more areas. Future area reworks ended up happening incrementally as I worked on larger updates instead, such as v0.6.0 and v0.8.0.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.3.2 was also another update with a controversial change: the removal of the tome of mastery from the start of the game. Prior to this change subclasses were available from floor 1 after you unlocked them. I changed this as I wanted to make subclasses more powerful and interesting, but having them available on floor 1 limited that.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ 83 days after Shattered v0.3.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.3.1 is the first update that I ended up regretting. While almost all of the content in these earlier updates has been revisited in some way, the trap changes were arguably detrimental to the game at the time they were implemented.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I was too obsessed with quantity over quality, and so I ended up adding lots of frustrating traps in the mid and lategame. I only ended up fixing this years later, primarily with the trap changes in v0.6.2 and v0.8.0. Incrementally adding well-designed traps over time would have been a much better approach.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Still, v0.3.1 wasn't all bad. Traps in the earlygame were improved, and it also introduced some very important interface changes such as four quickslots, expanded game settings, and quickslot autotargeting. This was also the first update that had a beta release, something that I've done for every update since.&quot;));
