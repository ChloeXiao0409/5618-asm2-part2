				&quot;_-_ Released August 6th, 2020\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 40 days after Shattered v0.8.1\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.8.2 was another followup to v0.8.0 in terms of game content. The dust was beginning to settle though and so fewer major balance changes were needed when comparing to v0.8.1.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The one major content change was the addition of a fifth equip slot! This was something that I  probably should have done when I initially added artifacts all the way back in v0.2.0. The extra slot both reduced competition between ring and artifacts and allowed for all sorts of new and interesting item builds. v0.8.0 also made the game harder overall, so giving the player an extra equip slot was a nice counterbalance.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Lastly, v0.8.2 included a crucial UI addition: an in-game news feed! I've always tried to be communicative to players who reach out to me, but lots of people will just passively wait for news to come to them. The news UI has made it possible for me to effectively communicate with everyone, not just players to seek me out.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L93">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.ARTIFACT_HORN1), &quot;Fifth Equipment Slot!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_An extra slot has been added for rings/artifacts_, bringing the total number of equip slots up to 5!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The player can now equip _one ring, one artifact, and one ring or artifact._ The third slot doesn't allow equipping three of the same type of item.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I'm hoping this change will reduce the amount that these two item types compete with each other, and also opens up some interesting new build possibilities!&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L98">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.NEWS), &quot;Ingame News Feed&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_A news feed has been added to the game's main menu!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;This feed pulls in blog posts from ShatteredPixel.com, and displays then within the game. It will also notify players when new posts are available.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I've wanted to improve my communication with the game's playerbase for quite a while, and this is a huge step in that direction.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L103">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.RING_TOPAZ), Messages.get(RingOfEnergy.class, &quot;name&quot;),</span>
				&quot;With the changes to equipment slots, I've taken the opportunity to buff and expand the _Ring of Energy_ a bit:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Ring of Energy wand recharge boost down to 20% from 30%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Ring of Energy now increases artifact recharge speed by 10%&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L112">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.DISPLAY), &quot;Interface Improvements&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Several of the game's interfaces have been substantially improved:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The title screen has received major layout changes. It now has links to the new news screen, and no longer has buttons cluttering the corners\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The supporter interface now has its own dedicated scene and improved visuals\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The settings window has been expanded with additional options for new and existing functionality\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Icons have been added to pages of the adventurer's guidebook\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Various minor tweaks/improvements to other interfaces&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L120">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.DATA), &quot;Google Play Functionality&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Several Improvements have been made to Google Play-specific functionality:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Shattered now supports Android instant app and instant game functionality, which lets new users try the game without installing it\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Google Play Games is now much smarter about when it prompts the player to sign in if they have already enabled it\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Google Play Games now prompts new users to sign in if they already have Google Play Games installed\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Journal sync is now supported by Google Play Games functionality&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L127">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.PREFS), Messages.get(ChangesScene.class, &quot;misc&quot;),</span>
				&quot;_Balance:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Bleed from gripping/flashing traps reduced, but they are also affected less by armor.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ All effects which cancel invisibility and time freeze now fully resolve before they cancel invis/freeze.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Swarm intelligence no longer triggers from allies, and no longer affects magically slept enemies.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Evil eyes are no longer immune to terror\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Thrown potions no longer cleanse ooze/fire from enemies\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Strength Potions, Upgrade Scrolls, and items which use them are now considered unique and are immune to burn/freeze\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Enemies now cannot spawn near to the player, even if they are out of the player's view\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Ranged traps will now prefer to shoot visible targets over invisible ones&quot;,

				&quot;_New Player Experience:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Snakes now give hints about surprise attacks after 3 misses, down from 5\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Accelerated the rate that guidebook pages drop on early floors\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The regular main menu is now only accessible after starting your first game\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Entrance doors on floor 2 are now only hidden the first time\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Audio:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ New sound effects have been added for sheep and the talisman of foresight\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The SFX for discovering secrets has been remastered\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Torches now play a burning sound\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Translations:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Added a new language: Ukranian!\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Updated translations and translator credits&quot;,

				&quot;_Quality of Life:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The dried rose can no longer be sold if it contains a weapon or armor\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Tweaked item visibility in furrowed grass\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Adjusted sizing for inventory and message windows\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Items now automatically get added to bags if room is made for them by dropping/using something else\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Questgivers now appear in landmarks when they are seen\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Shops now appear in landmarks\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Items for sale now show their price when being examined\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Stackable unique items can now be sold\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Shortened text from well of awareness\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Tweaked the sprites of tipped vs. untipped darts&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Wandmaker rarely spawning ontop of traps&quot;,

				&quot;The _Ring of Wealth_ is doing better after its buff/rework in v0.8.1, but it's still the weakest ring when upgraded. I'm making some more tweaks to improve its upgrade scaling, and put more emphasis on its new rare drops:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Regular drop chance boost down to 20% from 25%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Now gives a rare drop every 0-25 kills, down from 0-30\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Rare drops are now an equip every 4-8 times, down from 5-10\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Equip drop minimum upgrade now increments at +1/3/6/10/15, from +1/4/9/16/25&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L210">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new WandOfBlastWave(),</span>
				&quot;Based on feedback and balance data, I'm making some further adjustments to knockback effects and the _Wand of Blast Wave_:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Knockback effects now only close doors if they originate from a melee attack\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Wand of blast wave base damage down to 1-3 from 1-5\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Damage from knockback collision doubled\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Stun from knockback collision adjusted to 1+dist/2, from dist/2-dist\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;This should fix the usability disparity of knockback between melee and ranged, make stunning more consistent, give another slight buff to elastic/repulsion, and boost blast wave at higher levels without also making it much stronger at +0/+1.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L218">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new WandOfFireblast(),</span>
				&quot;While I'm happy with how consistent its new cone logic is, the _Wand of Fireblast_ lost a bit of its chaotic firepower in v0.8.1. So I'm giving it some of that back:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Fireblast can now trickshot just like other wands along the center of its cone\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Fireblast now bursts open doors and goes through them\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Increased Fireblast's range to 5/7/9 from 4/6/8&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L224">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.WAND_WARDING), &quot;Various Wand Buffs&quot;,</span>
				&quot;I'm buffing a few wands as a followup to the changes made in v0.8.1:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Wand of Warding_ is in a much better spot, but could still use a slight boost, so I'm increasing the efficiency of its sentries:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Sentry HP up to 35/54/84, from 30/48/70\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Upgrade heal up to 19/30, from 18/22\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Regular heal up to 9/12/16, from 8/10/15\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Wand of Lightning_ self damage down to 0.5x from 0.67x\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Wand of Magic Missile_ can now empower other wands of magic missile (but this does not create an empower loop)&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L241">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new Flail(),</span>

				&quot;The _Wand of Regrowth_ is currently doing well when heavily upgraded, and EXTREMELY well when lightly upgraded. To address this, I'm pulling some power out of its basic plant and grass generation, and putting a bit more into the golden lotus:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Grass per zap down to 3.67+lvl/3 from 3.5+lvl/2\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ Released June 27th, 2020\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 72 days after Shattered v0.8.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;In terms of game content v0.8.1 was mostly a followup to v0.8.0. There were a lot of items that needed to be buffed or nerfed as a result of all the boss and enemy changes. I also took this as an opportunity to make a few item reworks. A few of the new boss and enemy mechanics were also adjusted based on balance data and player feedback.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;This update had some pretty big additions aside from game content though, with hero splash art and new sound effects! The splash art in particular was a long time coming, I first approached Aleksandar about them in 2016! While new game content is perhaps more exciting, these presentation improvements were a really important addition to Shattered, especially when it comes to enticing new players to try the game.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L278">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.DISPLAY), &quot;New Hero Select!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;The game's hero select screen has been completely overhauled, and how shows off the heroes in more detail than ever before.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The new hero select features a minimal UI that retains all the old functionality while trying to keep out of the way as much as possible. The centerpiece of hero select is now the heroes themselves, who are depicted with _new detailed splash arts_ by Aleksandar Komitov! _Make sure check out their credits listing in the new about page!_&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L282">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.AUDIO), &quot;Sound Effects&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_15+ new sound effects_ have been added to the game, courtesy of Charlie! _Make sure check out their credits listing in the new about page!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;These sounds cover movement, combat, and a bunch of miscellanious situations:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Grass now crunches underfoot (extra loud if it's tall grass), and solid floors now have a more solid sound.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The default hitsound has been remastered, and weapons can now produce slashing, stabbing, or crushing sounds.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Bows, crossbows, and projectile wands have new shooting/hitting sounds.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ A new heavy impact sound plays when you land a surprise attack, and a new blocking sound when damage is negated by parrying or shields.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Some misc sounds have also been added for: gas spewing, chains being thrown, magical effects charging up, and the player being hit to low health.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I've also remastered the title and ending music tracks to improve their quality and volume.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Talisman no longer gains EXP from the hero finding secrets\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 'uneasy' status no longer lingers when traps aren't in range\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Passive charge speed at max level reduced by 33%\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The talisman's scry active ability has been redesigned:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Scry now projects outward in a cone, in a direction and distance of the player's choice.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Everything within scry's range is revealed, including the map, secrets, and enemies/items.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The player gets temporary mind vision on revealed enemies/items.\n&quot; +

				&quot;My hope with this change is to make magic missile more worthy of upgrades if the player is going for a sort of 'wandslinger' build, while still maintaining the wands weakness when used solo.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I intend to closely watch how this change plays out, and make adjustments if it ends up messing with the Mage too much. As a start to this, the _Battlemage_ on-hit effect for magic missile has been toned down, to prevent a magic missile staff plus a single low-level wand being stronger than just imbuing that wand.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ 197 days after Shattered v0.7.5\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 546 days after Shattered v0.7.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.8.0 is easily the largest update Shattered has ever received in terms of game content. It included sweeping changes to basically every enemy after floor 10. This included full reworks to three of the game's bosses, which were some of the most well-received changes I've ever made to Shattered.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;These changes also heavily influenced item and class balance. Offense and defense became more fairly balanced, as many enemies gained mechanics that couldn't be ignored by just dealing more damage to them. I would say this update marks another new era in Shattered's development, as the experience of playing the game changed so substantially.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;At over 6 months v0.8.0 also took longer than any other update and it could have easily been released as 3 smaller updates instead. I felt similarly about v0.7.0, and since then I've tried to structure content releases so that updates don't take longer than about 3 months.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Removed bonus damage vs enemies in water.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The Max level for hero to earn exp from them is reduced to 13 from 14.\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;_Golden and Crystal Mimics_ have also been added! Golden mimics have higher stats but a better reward, and crystal mimics will try to run away with their loot! Neither require a key to open.\n\n&quot;+
