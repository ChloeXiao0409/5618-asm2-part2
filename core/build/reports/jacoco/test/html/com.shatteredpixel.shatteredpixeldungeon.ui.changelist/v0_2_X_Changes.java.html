				&quot;_-_ Released February 23rd, 2015\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 48 days after Shattered v0.2.3\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.2.4 was a very important update, even if it was mainly porting another update from Pixel Dungeon's source code. This is because the v1.7.5 source included a change that was quite controversial: Degradation.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;In Pixel Dungeon (after v1.7.5) upgraded gear degrades as it is used, and this degradation is usually reset by upgrading an item further. The goal of this change was to discourage hoarding upgrades and dumping them on a single weapon, but (especially in v.1.7.5) many players felt that degradation ruined the fun of the game.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;After a lot of consideration, I decided to not implement degradation into Shattered. Instead I started planning other changes to solve this problem without restricting gameplay quite as much. Those changes would eventually show up in updates like v0.4.0 and v0.8.0.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ 64 days after Shattered v0.2.2\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.2.3 was another update made of many small improvements. The most significant game content in this update was major additions and refinements to artifacts, including preventing duplicates.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;This was also the first update where I started really trying to focus on game stability and code quality. In v0.2.3 I made some big changes to the internal code of the game's save system, which fixed lots of cases where the game would fail to save and load properly.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Lastly, v0.2.3 brought the addition of the game's supporter system! While monetization isn't as exciting as new game content, the supporter system is the primary reason why I've been able to work on the game for so long.&quot;));

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.2.2 was Shattered's first update that didn't have a specific focus. Instead this update was focused on making a bunch of little improvements.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The largest change was the integration of Pixel Dungeon's source code from v1.7.2, which included synchronous movement! It's something we take for granted now, but before this change every on-screen character had to move one at a time. This slowed the pace of the game to a crawl whenever enemies were on screen.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Heroes remains also received big changes this update. In Pixel Dungeon you could use remains to consistently pass highly upgraded armor from one run to the next. I felt this violated the roguelike nature of the game, and so I nerfed remains to prevent this.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L154">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.STONE_AUGMENTATION, null), &quot;Pixel Dungeon v1.7.2&quot;,</span>

				&quot;Remains have additional limitations:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Heros will no longer drop remains if they have obtained the amulet of yendor, or die 5 or more floors above the deepest floor they have reached\n&quot; +

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.2.1 was the first in a short lived series of 'region overhaul' updates. Thanks to releasing on Google Play, Shattered was getting a huge influx of new players, and I wanted to make some changes that they would appreciate. The three new minibosses and Goo changes were all made to try and help new players get used to the game.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ 41 days after Shattered v0.1.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.2.0 was the first version of Shattered to release on Google Play! I had originally wanted to wait longer, but I was getting flooded with messages about it.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Artifacts came from realizing it would be very difficult to make some rings worth upgrading by just buffing them. Instead, I decided to put their mechanics  on a new class of item that didn't need upgrades. Artifacts ended up becoming Shattered's first flagship feature!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I feel like this was the start of a new era for Shattered's development, as updates become about making much more significant changes to content than just balance adjustments.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Giving the Cloak of Shadows to the Rogue was also my first attempt at a class rework. It was a much more simple change than later reworks, and I ended up revisiting the Rogue in v0.6.2.&quot;));
