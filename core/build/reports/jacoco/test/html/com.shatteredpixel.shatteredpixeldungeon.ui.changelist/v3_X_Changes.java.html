				&quot;The next major update to Shattered will be v3.1, which will mainly focus on followup to v3.0 and some changes to the Warrior!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I expect v3.1 to be a relatively lightweight update, much like v2.1 was after the Duelist. v2.1 took almost 3 months, and while I'd like to do better than that I also don't want to end up overpromising. Hopefully you'll hear from me with progress on v3.1 sometime in mid April to mid May.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Please keep in mind that while I always try to keep to the ETAs I provide, they are just estimates. If you don't hear from me by the ETA, it means I'm still busy with the update!&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L62">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(HeroSprite.avatar(HeroClass.WARRIOR, 6), &quot;Warrior Changes&quot;,</span>
				&quot;For a long while now the Warrior has been the least appreciated class among experienced players. This is partly intended because he is meant to be the most simple, but I do think there are some changes that can be made so that the Warrior's class ability is a bit more visible and interactive. This is not going to be a hero rework, but rather some targeted changes to improve the Warrior's game feel without making him much harder for new players to use.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L65">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(HeroSprite.avatar(HeroClass.CLERIC, 6), &quot;Cleric Followup&quot;,</span>
				&quot;I'm more confident that the Cleric is releasing in a better initial state than the Duelist, but there will always be needed changes to balance or mechanics, and fixes for bugs. I expect to make those changes in v3.1 after taking a little time to gather feedback and gameplay data from v3.1.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L68">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.PREFS), &quot;Misc. Changes&quot;,</span>
				&quot;I want v3.1 to be a fairly lightweight update, so that it can come out quickly in response to v3.0, but there should be room for a few smaller changes too. In addition to the usual bugfixes and smaller QoL tweaks, I might add a couple of smaller content additions such as new trinkets and other items, a new rare enemy, etc.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L71">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.WARNING), &quot;Older Device Support&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Unfortunately I will have to make some changes in 2025 that will remove support for very old versions of iOS, Android, and Java:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;**iOS 11:** Support for this version of iOS is being dropped after v3.0 (this update). There were no Apple devices which got iOS 11 but not 12, so this shouldn't actually affect any users.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;**Android 4.0-4.4:** Due to updates to Shattered's game library (libGDX) and Google Play's billing library, I will sadly have to drop support for these older Android versions toward the end of 2025. These Android versions should still get v3.1 and v3.2 though.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;**Java 8-10:** This only affects users who play the old desktop JAR distribution, which requires a separate Java install. Support for the Java 8, 9, and 10 targets has been depreciated, at some point in the future Shattered will require Java 11 instead. I'll likely make this change at the same time as the Android change.&quot;));

					&quot;A bug was fixed in this patch which affected display scaling on Steam Deck. Due to a quirk in how the Steam Deck reported display dimensions, the game incorrectly thought Steam Deck's screen was about 4\&quot;, instead of 7\&quot;.\n&quot; +
					&quot;\n&quot; +
					&quot;As a result of this fix, you might notice that the interface appears differently as it now defaults to the 'full' UI mode instead of 'mobile'. If you prefer the previous interface mode, you can swap to it in the settings by using the mobile interface mode and 5x interface scale.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L99">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.PREFS), Messages.get(ChangesScene.class, &quot;misc&quot;),</span>

				&quot;**Caused by v3.0:**\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Errors with Android golden supporter UI and full interface mode\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Cleric's Recall Glyph spell not working with some runestones while time was frozen\n&quot; +

				&quot;**Existed Prior to v3.0:**\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Game incorrectly thinking it is on a phone screen when played on Steam Deck\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Water of Awareness buff persisting between floors if the hero is very fast\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Various errors when saving/loading custom controller bindings\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Visual errors when Tengu's sprite animations are frozen (e.g. via paralysis)\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Characters still appearing as visible if knocked out of hero FOV in specific cases\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Talisman of Foresight's scry ability not detecting hiding mimics\n&quot; +

				&quot;So far the Cleric is doing surprisingly well balance-wise! There are definitely some things to adjust, but nothing that's serious enough to need doing in a patch. I'm just making one change to put a limit on ring of energy shenanigans for the Paladin:\n&quot; +
				&quot;**- Holy Weapon and Ward** can now be extended to a max of 100 turns at a time.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;After v3.0's nerf to the Mossy Clump, I'm going to experiment with scaling back its absurd upgrade cost. Hopefully it's at a power level now where it doesn't need to cost massively more than other trinkets:\n&quot; +
				&quot;**- Mossy Clump** upgrade energy cost reduced to 10/15/20 from 20/25/30. This is now the same as other 'higher cost' trinkets.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L130">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.PREFS), Messages.get(ChangesScene.class, &quot;misc&quot;),</span>
				&quot;Firstly, two trinket changes that are meant as QoL, but are effectively mild buffs:\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Salt Cube's regen reduction now automatically disables itself during boss fights, the trinket doesn't need to be dropped.\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Waterskin drinking now more intelligently handles the extra healing from vial of blood, no longer consuming excess dew.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;And some other things:\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Updated Translations\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Cursed wand pitfall effect no longer drops items if triggered via wondrous resin\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Feint armor ability no longer autotargets\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Removed support for runs in progress from prior to v2.3.2 (Jan. 2024)\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Removed internal code for old blacksmith quest from prior to v2.2 (Oct. 2023)&quot;));

				&quot;**Ascended Form** grants the Cleric access to new spells, extra attack ranged, and shielding whenever they cast spells.\n&quot; +

				&quot;**Trinity** lets the Cleric access the effects of items they've previously identified in their run without the items themselves.\n&quot; +

				&quot;**-** The Mage has recieved moderate changes\n&quot; +

				&quot;**-** The Warrior's splash remains unchanged for the moment, but improvements to it are coming soon as well!\n&quot; +

				&quot;**Highlights:**\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Turned off auto-targeting in cases where it was almost always wrong (Bless spell, Wand of Warding, etc.)\n&quot; +
				&quot;**-** Enemies are now more willing to switch targets if their target is retreating and they are being attacked by something else\n&quot; +

				&quot;**- Shared Upgrades** now grants 2.5%/5%/7.5% bonus damage per upgrade per tier, instead of a flat 10%/20%/30% bonus damage per upgrade. Functionally, this means -50% bonus dmg for T2 thrown weapons, -25% for T3, no changes for T4, and +25% for T5.&quot;));
