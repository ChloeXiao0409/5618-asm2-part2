				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Dev commentary will be added here in the future&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L73">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.JOURNAL.get(), &quot;Journal Overhaul!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_The game's Journal interface has been completely overhauled!_\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Notes section has an entirely new grid-based UI with new icons, and _support for custom notes!_ Custom notes feature user-enterable text and can be tied to a floor, specific item, item type, or just be plain text.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Catalogs section has also been moved to a grid UI, and has been massively expanded with _almost 500 entries!_ The catalogs now contain almost every item in the game, and a bestiary featuring almost every character, plant, and trap! There are also _9 new badges_ which can be unlocked by filling the catalogs out!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;You can also now _view badges directly from the journal_, both the ones for your current run and overall badges.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The guidebook tabs are unchanged, and the lore tab has been merged into the catalogs.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L84">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.SALT_CUBE), &quot;New Trinkets!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_Four new trinkets have been added!_ Bringing the total to 15 trinkets.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Salt Cube_ extends the duration that food keeps you full, but also reduces HP regeneration.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Vial of Blood_ increases the healing granted by major healing sources, but also slows that healing down.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Shard of Oblivion_ increases the amount of loot you'll find from enemies when you are wearing unidentified equipment.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Chaotic Censer_ randomly spreads gasses nearby, that are harmful to you and to enemies.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;There is also now a fourth 'random' option when selecting trinkets, if you don't want any of the first three.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L97">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.DISPLAY_LAND.get(), &quot;Region Splash Arts!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_New splash arts have been added to the game's loading screens!_\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;There's one for each of the five regions, once again made by Aleksandar Komitov!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Loading times have not been increased, but the first loading screen of each region now pauses to display that region's story text. This gives an opportunity to appreciate the art without making players wait longer on every loading screen. The game will even start panning the loading screen art during this pause for mobile portrait users!&quot;));

				&quot;In addition to the journal overhaul, there are several smaller UI changes and additions in this update too:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Scrolls of Upgrade_ now have a preview window that appears when they are used, that summarizes how the stats of an item will change when upgraded.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The main menu _Badges Screen_ has been replaced with a new journal screen, containing the catalogs and guidebooks as well as unlocked badges.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Alchemy Screen_ has been adjusted, primarily for desktop users. The guidebook button is now more visible, and shows the guidebook to the side when used on desktop.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The game now displays a little congratulations message after your first win, and clarity on what winning the game unlocks has been improved.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L119">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.WAND_MAGIC_MISSILE), &quot;Cursed Wand Expansion&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Cursed wand effects have been massively expanded! There are now 16 new effects bringing the total number of effects up to 32. These include simple common effects like shooting bubbles and new super rare effects like a giant supernova explosion!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;A few existing cursed effects have also been changed:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Reduced healing from the uncommon health transfer effect by 50%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The uncommon 'shock and recharge' effect is now a lightning bolt, does more damage to a target and grants less wand recharge\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The rare inter-floor teleport effect now caps at sending the player back 10 floors&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L127">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.BACKPACK_LRG.get(), &quot;Inventory Management Improvements&quot;,</span>
				&quot;I've made various smaller changes to make inventory management a bit easier:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The potion bandolier can now store the waterskin, and the scroll holder can now store arcane styli\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Converting a potion or scroll into alchemical energy now also identifies it\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Reduced the chance for multiple equipment drops from slimes, skeletons, guards, DM-200s, and golems\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Increased the base drop rate of equipment from DM-200s and golems to compensate\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Stones of Intuition now always get 2 uses each, even if the first guess is incorrect\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Dark dungeon levels no longer contain a torch, but also reduce vision by 3/8, down from 4/8&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L137">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.BOMB), &quot;Bombs and Identification&quot;,</span>
				&quot;I've fixed a long-standing exploit where players could use explosions to determine if equipment was upgraded. Explosions will now avoid destroying any equipment, previously they would destroy un-upgraded equipment only.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;As compensation to this change, I'm changing up a runestone, and buffing bombs and explosion effects:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Firstly _Stones of Detect Magic_ are a new item that replace stones of disarming. Each stone can be used on a piece of equipment to identify whether it is cursed, and whether it is enchanted/upgraded. This should give a few more options when it comes to IDing equipment.&quot;,

				&quot;Secondly, bombs and explosion effects are buffed across the board:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Explosion max damage +50% (this increases average damage by 33%)\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Bombs no longer bounce when thrown directly at characters\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Damage falloff removed from ALL explosion and bomb types\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Alchemy bombs now all explode in a minimum AOE of 5x5 (up from 3x3)\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Flashbangs_ redesigned, they are now smoke bombs, and spread shrouding fog in a 5x5 AOE in addition to dealing damage.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Shocks Bombs_ redesigned, they are now flashbangs, and deal +25% electricity damage and stun for 10 turns within their 5x5 AOE.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Regrowth Bomb_ AOE size up to 7x7 from 5x5, now always generate at least 3 plants, up from 2.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Improved visibility of the ambitious imp\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Trinkets can now be energized to get 5 energy back\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Rings transmuted from artifacts can now be +1 or +2 if the artifact was +5 or +10\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ Added a new buff icon for wand-based buffs\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ ShatteredPD is now categorized as a game on Android devices\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Updated translations and translator credits\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Added dev commentary for v1.4.0&quot;));

				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- 13 Leaf Clover_ upgrade cost up, but it now only affect the hero's damage rolls. It no longer applies to armor or enemy attacks. This should preserve the intended chaos of the effect without making enemies way more dangerous.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Dimensional Sundial_ upgrade cost up, but it now slightly reduces enemy spawn rates during daytime. 'nighttime' has also been adjusted to be 8pm-8am, from 9pm-7am.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Wondrous Resin_'s bonus cursed wand effects are now always neutral or positive.\n&quot; +

				&quot;The Duelist is doing much better balance-wise since v2.4.0, but there are various specific abilities that are getting boosts this update:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Weapon Abilities:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Lunge, Cleave, Spike, Retribution, and Brawler's Stance_ abilities all now deal more bonus damage\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Crossbow's Charge Shot_ ability can now also cause a melee attack to knock back, or an untipped dart attack to deal bonus damage. Tipped dart benefits unchanged.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Talents:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Liquid Evasion_ talent evasion at +1 reduced to 3x from 4x, but the talent now also grants bonus accuracy on the next attack. \n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Lethal Haste_ talent now grants instant movement, instead of haste.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Swift Equip_ talent's second use at +2 no longer has a 5 turn timer.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Deadly Followup_ talent damage per level up to +10% from +8%.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Precise Assault_ accuracy bonus increased to 2x/5x/inf., up from 2x/4x/8x.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Expose Weakness_ talent now applies weakness as well as vulnerable.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L294">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(HeroSprite.avatar(HeroClass.DUELIST, 4), &quot;Monk Buffs&quot;,</span>
				&quot;v2.4.0's Duelist buffs were mainly focused on weapon abilities, which mainly benefit the Champion, so it makes sense that the Monk has fallen a little behind. I'm giving out several buffs and mechanics changes to boost the Monk back up, which should improve every ability she has, except meditate.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Removed ability cooldowns entirely, except for flurry which has a 1 turn cooldown\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Flurry_ damage increased by 50%\n&quot; +

				&quot;_- Dash_ range increased by 33%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Dragon Kick_ damage doubled\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Unencumbered Spirit_ energy gain changed to 50%/75%/100% from 40%/80%/120%\n&quot; +

<span class="nc" id="L306">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.UNSTABLE_SPELL), &quot;Other Buffs&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_- Wand Preservation_ talent now always succeeds, no longer grants arcane resin on failure, and is limited to 1 use at +1, and 1 use per level at +2. \n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Rogue's foresight_ talent trigger chance increased to 75% at +1 and 100% at +2, up from 60% and 90%.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Hold Fast_ talent now grants 1-2 armor per level, up from 0-2.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Ring of Energy_ charge rate boost up to 17.5% per level, from 15%.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Unstable Brew_ now guarantees an appropriate potion effect when thrown or drank, instead of making it more likely.\n&quot; +

				&quot;The Mossy Clump is still far and away the strongest trinket, despite several nerfs since adding it. At this point it's clear the value of that trinket is more reflective of how powerful grassy floors are, rather than the trinket itself.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;So, I'm nerfing the drop-rate of dew from grassy floors by 50%, meaning that they will generate 2x as much dew as a regular floor on average, down from 4x. Seed drops from these floor are unaffected.\n&quot; +

				&quot;I've made several changes to the Ascension challenge to make it more fun, mesh better with some items/effects, and to smooth out its difficulty:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Enemies now gain increased max HP during ascent, instead of damage resistance\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Enemies now grant exp to the hero up to level 30 while ascending\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Even at level 30, on-exp-gain effects will now still trigger as long as the amulet's curse is being weakened\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;The _Lightweight Charge_ talent has been completely replaced with a new talent: _Precise Assault_. This new talent grants a big accuracy boost for 1 attack after using a weapon ability, encouraging interweaving special and regular attacks.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Lightweight Charge is removed as it was originally designed much earlier in the Duelist's development process. This was before mechanics like Swift Equip, the Champion's Dual wielding, or Unencumbered Spirit existed. Those mechanics do a much better job of encouraging using abilities on lower tier weapons.&quot;));

It seems that I've overestimated how much the drawbacks I added have held back many of these abilities. My hope with these changes is to better balance other abilities versus the simple-yet-effective Cleave.\n&quot; +

				&quot;_- Sneak_ invis duration up to 10/8/6 from 8/6/4\n&quot; +

				&quot;_- Sword Dance_ now gives +25% ACC, up from -20%, duration down to 5 turns from 6\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Spin_ now guarantees a hit at all levels, instead of just at 3 spins\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Retribution_ damage bonus up to +50% from +35%\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Heavy Blow:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Now always hits, but costs 2 charges if it is not surprise attacking\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Damage boost reduced to 50-30%, from 70-50%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Now applies a new 'daze' debuff instead of vulnerable or weakness. Daze halves accuracy and evasion for 5 turns.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Charged Shot:_\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Now grants +4 dart tip uses, up from +2\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ Flurry enchantment power up to 100% from 75%\n&quot; +

				&quot;v2.0.0 introduced Shattered Pixel Dungeon's first ever new hero: the Duelist!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Duelist was the first of two new heroes that were focused around active abilities, as opposed to focusing on equipment power (Warrior and Mage), or environment interaction (Rogue and Huntress). I see v2.0 as the beginning of another new era in Shattered's development, as after focusing on new platforms during most of v1.X, game updates instead started focusing on big content expansions.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Unfortunately the Duelist ended up releasing quite weak. I overestimated how well an ability focused hero would perform versus the existing heroes. I erred much more on the side of making the next hero stronger, and so far that seems to be working out quite well.&quot;));

				&quot;I'm making several buffs to various items that could be performing a little better:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Pickaxe_ can now benefit from upgrades enchantments and augmentation, if you feel like using it for fun.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Ring of Energy_ now also applies a recharging boost to hero armor abilities. All the boosts it gives are now standardized to +15%.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Ring of Arcana_ enchantment boost up to +17.5% per level, from +15%\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Glyph of Repulsion_ now only knocks back enemies who are adjacent to the hero. This should make it slightly better versus ranged enemies.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Glyph of Flow_ now grants +50% movespeed in water per level, up from +25%\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Horn of Plenty_ now gains 2 levels from being fed a pasty, up from 1.5\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Horn of Plenty_ now gains 4 levels from being fed a meat pie, up from 3&quot;));

				&quot;A couple buffs to the two worst performing armor abilities/talents:\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Shrug it Off_ now just directly boosts the damage resistance from endure to 60/68/74/80%, instead of reducing max damage taken\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Wild Magic_ now spends 0.5 wand charges at base. Conserved magic can reduce this to 0.1\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I expect the next update will include more hero balance changes, after the dust settles from the Duelist.&quot;));

				&quot;_- Timekeeper's Hourglass_ sand bag cost up to 30 from 20\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Alchemist's Toolkit_ now requires 6 energy per level, up from 5\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Wand of Fireblast_ base damage reduced to 1-2 from 1-6 when spending 1 charge, and 2-8 from 2-12 when spending 2 charges. This is to offset the relatively high amount of DOT the wand deals at low levels.&quot;));
