				&quot;_-_ Released October 4th, 2022\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 90 days after Shattered v1.3.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I called v1.4.0 'the big patch' while it was in development, as the goal of the update was to try and clear through a backlog of smaller fixes and improvements that was starting to get very long.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I've kept getting so many reports that future updates have been pretty fix-heavy too though. Some of Shattered's players are very, very dedicated to pushing the game to its limits, and so it sometimes feels like every fix I make just prompts these people to go find problems elsewhere.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;There was new content in v1.4.0 as well, most notably the addition of in-game lore! I've had lots of loose ideas for a proper backstory to Shattered for a long time, and v1.4.0 was the first update that started to put some of that into the actual game! Future lore has had to wait until after the addition of new heroes though.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L83">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.GUIDE_PAGE), &quot;Lore Additions&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_30 pages of lore text have been added to the game, scattered around the regions of the dungeon!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;These pages are found through the dungeon and go into a new tab in the journal window. Each region contains 6 pages that make up a short story that gives more details about that region and the people who have been there before the player.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L87">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.RING_TOURMALINE), new RingOfArcana().trueName(),</span>
				&quot;_A new ring has been added that enhances enchantments and glyphs!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Ring of Arcana lets the player directly power up their enchantments and glyphs, instead of only being able to power them up by upgrading the item they are attached to. This can lead to be some really potent enchant/glyph effects at high ring levels.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L91">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new SandalsOfNature(),</span>
				&quot;_The Sandals of Nature have been given a new active ability!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Rather than just using the effect of earthroot, the footwear of nature now use the effect of the seed most recently fed to them! These effects can be triggered on nearby enemies instead of just on you, opening up a bunch of tactical potential for this artifact.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;For balance, the amount of extra seeds/dew the footwear gives has been reduced, and 1 additional seed is needed for each upgrade level.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L96">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new Image(Assets.Sprites.WARRIOR, 0, 90, 12, 15), HeroSubClass.BERSERKER.title(),</span>
				&quot;_The Berserker's berserk ability is now manually activated, but has a much lower cooldown._\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I'm doing this to try and make the subclass a bit more engaging, players can now trigger berserk at any point when they have 100% or more rage. Berserking still gives a big bonus shield, letting the Berserker survive normally fatal encounters. The lower the Berserker's health, the more shielding he gets.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Berserker's talents have been adjusted as well:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Endless Rage_ Now grants bonuses to berserk duration and cooldown when above 100% rage.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Berserking Stamina_ has been replaced with _Deathless Fury_, which lets berserking automatically trigger just like before, but at a high cooldown cost.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L103">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.MASTERY), &quot;Tutorial Additions&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_A short guided tutorial has been added at the start of the game for new players._\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;This tutorial guides the player through their first few actions, and encourages reading the game log and guidebook.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;As part of this tutorial change, initial story texts and the guidebook have been slightly adjusted, and there is a new pop-up for controller players that explains how to use the in-game cursor.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L108">		changes = new ChangeInfo(Messages.get(ChangesScene.class, &quot;changes&quot;), false, null);</span>

<span class="nc" id="L112">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton( new TalentIcon(Talent.EMPOWERED_STRIKE), &quot;T3 Talent Redesigns&quot;,</span>
				&quot;I've made some pretty significant changes to three T3 talents that were either unpopular or too simplistic:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Empowered Strike_ now gives a little less direct staff damage, but also boosts the staff's on-hit effect. This should make it more interesting while still encouraging staff melee play.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Excess Charge_ now triggers when the Mage's staff is zapped at full charge, instead of on-hit, but the barrier effect is a bit stronger. This should encourage a mix of staff melee and zapping, instead of just pure melee at full charge.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Bounty Hunter_ now increases enemy drop chance, instead of providing gold. This should make it more varied and interesting. The bonus also gets notably higher at high preparation charge, instead of scaling linearly.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L118">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton( new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.LONGSWORD, new ItemSprite.Glowing(0x0000FF)), &quot;Blocking Enchant Redesign&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Blocking has been slightly redesigned to provide a more visible benefit. Instead of always granting a little armor, the enchantment now has a chance to grant a larger shield.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I don't expect that this will make the enchantment significantly stronger or weaker, but it should feel more impactful.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L122">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.DISPLAY_LAND), &quot;Landscape Hero Select&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Desktop and mobile landscape users will now see a new hero select screen that better makes use of screen real-estate.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Yog's laser now deducts score even if the hero dodges it\n&quot; +

				&quot;_Levelgen:_\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ Added a setting to adjust camera follow intensity\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ The controller pointer can now pan the game camera\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Heroes can now be renamed individually&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Released July 6th, 2022\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 105 days after Shattered v1.2.0\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;v1.3.0 was largely a followup update to v1.2, with an emphasis on adding features that better fleshed out the game for all the new players on desktop platforms.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The headline feature for this update was the addition of custom seeds, daily runs, and a new scoring system for them to make use of. Prior to this update the scoring system was totally based on depth reached and treasure collected, rather than actual performance during the run. A better score system gave players a better way to measure their performance, against themselves or other players.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v1.3.0 also introduced a new much harder ascension challenge. Prior to this ascending was mostly a chore with no real increase to difficulty. With more challenge and a score bonus for doing it, players finally had a reason to try to ascend instead of ending the game on floor 26.&quot;));

				&quot;If you don't enter a custom seed, the game will use a random one to generate a random dungeon, just like it did prior to this update.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Note that only players who have won at least once can enter custom seeds, and games with custom seeds are not eligible to appear in rankings.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Released March 23rd, 2022\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 103 days after Shattered v1.1.0\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;v1.2.0 focused on a number of improvements to try and make Shattered play just as well for desktop users as it does for phone users. While these changes weren't perfect right at launch, they played a major role in making Shattered feel like more than a mobile port and helped it have a successful launch on Steam.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;One big change for desktop users that's external to the game itself was native executables. Previously Shattered's desktop version required a separate installation of Java to run. After v1.2.0, I started making versions of Shattered with built-in Java instead. This meant that most users could just download the game and run it, much nicer.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v1.2.0 also included a variety of little additions and tweaks. Most of them are self-explanatory, but the badge additions in particular were timed with the game's release on Steam so they could tie into steamworks achievements and give newer players a little more to do.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Full controller support, including button bindings and an analog stick cursor.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Better keyboard controls, including combining keys to move diagonally.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Better mouse support, including hover tooltips and right-click menus.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Two additional quickslots on the new UI, and on mobile UI if there is enough space.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Integration with Steamworks for achievements and cloud sync.\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ Released December 10th, 2021\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 115 days after Shattered v1.0.0\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;v1.1.0 was the start of Shattered's alchemy system actually doing the job it was supposed to do way back in v0.7.0. Previously alchemical energy sort of sat on top of the alchemy system and acted as a hard cap on how many 'powerful' recipes the player could use in a run. Thanks to v1.1.0's changes, energy replaced specific ingredients in a huge number of recipes, which made the system massively more flexible. Lots of specific alchemy items also received big buffs or redesigns, making them much more worthwhile to create.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;This update also included new region-specific music tracks composed by Kristjan Haaristo! Kristjan was actually a fan of Shattered before working on the music and contacted me about potentially adding new tracks. I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to work with people that are just as passionate about Shattered as I am.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L674">		changes.addButton(new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.ENERGY), &quot;Alchemical Energy Overhaul&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_The role of Alchemical Energy in the alchemy system has been totally overhauled!_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Energy is now a resource that the player carries with themselves, like gold. The game also generates much less energy for free, but more can be created by scrapping consumable items.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Many recipes have been adjusted to compensate for this. Exotic potions and scrolls now require energy instead of seeds/stones, and several of them have been buffed or totally redesigned (see buffs and changes sections for more details).\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Other recipes have received relatively minor changes for now (mostly energy cost tweaks), but I'll likely be giving them more attention soon in future updates.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;This repositions energy as the primary driving force for alchemy, and should make the system both more flexible and better at recycling consumables the player doesn't want into ones that they do.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L681">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.SUMMON_ELE), &quot;New and Reworked Spells&quot;,</span>
				&quot;While this update mostly focused changes on exotic potions and scrolls, there are _two new spells, and one totally redesigned spell:_\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Summon Elemental_ requires fresh embers and an arcane catalyst. It can be used to summon a friendly elemental to fight for you, and can even be powered up with other items!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Telekinetic Grab_ requires some liquid metal and an arcane catalyst. It can be used to grab items remotely, even thrown items that are stuck to an enemy!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_Alchemize_ has been totally redesigned. It now only requires an arcane catalyst, and is used to convert items into gold or alchemical energy on the go. I'm really hoping this spell helps with inventory management.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Because of the redesign to alchemize, the merchant's beacon and magical porter are made mostly redundant and have been removed from the game. Shops now sell a few uses of alchemize instead.&quot;));

Prior to this Shattered's first version number was always 0, and patches were appended as letters. Rather than jumping all the way from v0.9.3 to v10.0.0, I opted to reset Shattered back to v1.0.0 for this update. This was done both for tidiness, and to signal another new era in Shattered's development.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I actually originally intended for this update to be v0.9.4, but a requirement by Apple forced me to change the versioning scheme just before the full release. In retrospect, I'm extremely glad that this update became v1.0.0.
