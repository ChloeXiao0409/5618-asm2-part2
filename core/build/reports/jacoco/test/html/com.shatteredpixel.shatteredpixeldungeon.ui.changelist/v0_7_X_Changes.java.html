				&quot;_-_ Released October 2nd, 2019\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 76 days after Shattered v0.7.4\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.7.5 was a precursor update to v0.8.0, with reworks and expansions to enemies and bosses in the first two regions of the game. I focused on the first two regions for this update as I was already reasonably happy with them after improvements from much earlier updates, and so the changes needed were more minor. I was originally planning to do each future region in its own update, but ended up balling them all up into v0.8.0, which took half a year as a result!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The only major correction to these changes that I needed to make in the future were to Tengu's boss fight. In the second phase of the fight in v0.7.5 the player had to navigate around traps while Tengu was offscreen. I wanted this to be a bit of a break, but it felt more like it interrupted the fight than anything else. After v0.8.0 it was clear to me that multi-phase bosses did not need break phases, and so I removed the second phase from Tengu.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L86">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new Image(Assets.Sprites.SNAKE, 12, 0, 12, 11), &quot;Sewer Enemies&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Two new enemies have been added to the sewers!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Snakes_ are an evasive enemy which mainly shows up on early floors, they help teach the importance of surprise attacks.\n&quot; +
				&quot;_- Slimes_ primarily appear on floor 4, and are an enemy type which rewards defense over damage.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Goo's level has also received significant changes. It now uses a new unique level layout pattern, and Goo itself always spawns in a new unique room type.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I have also made slight balance changes to the Goo fight itself. 1x1 pillars have been mostly removed from Goo's arena to reduce surprise-attack spam, but Goo's damage has been reduced by 20% to compensate.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L93">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new Image(Assets.Sprites.TENGU, 0, 0, 14, 16), &quot;Prison Enemies&quot;,</span>
				&quot;_Necromancers_ have been added to the prison! These powerful enemies fight by summoning and buffing undead.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The _Tengu_ boss fight has been totally reworked! The fight still takes place over 3 stages, and has a similar core theme, but I have totally ditched the tedious maze and chasing mechanics from stages 2&amp;3, and have given Tengu several new abilities. Watch your step!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;As a part of this rework, Tengu's stats have also been adjusted:\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ HP up to 160 from 120\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Evasion reduced by 25%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Damage reduced by 30%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Accuracy reduced by 10%&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L102">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.LIBGDX), &quot;libGDX Text Rendering!&quot;,</span>
				&quot;The game's text renderer is now using libGDX freetype. This looks almost identical to the existing text but is slightly crisper, platform-independent, and much more efficient!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Text rendering was the last bit of android-dependant code, so the game's core code modules (~98% of its code) are now being compiled as general code and not android-specific code!&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Released July 18th, 2019\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 56 days after Shattered v0.7.3\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.7.4 was mainly focused around allies, featuring two new ally-focused wands and a bunch of changes to existing ally-granting items. In particular, the changes to ally AI made a huge impact on how usable they were as dedicated partners through the dungeon. Disposable allies (such as mirror images) always worked decently, but prior to v0.7.4 it was usually a liability to invest upgrades into ally-granting items.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;The two wands added in this update were actually originally concepted all the way back in v0.3.0. I ended up shelving them at the time as I wasn't confident that I would be able to implement them well.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.7.4 was also the first update to begin laying groundwork for releasing Shattered on other platforms! While it would still take a while after this to actually release there, these technical changes were an important first step.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L204">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new WandOfWarding(),</span>
				&quot;This brand new wand spawns autonomous wards which attack enemies. Wards can be upgraded by being zapped again, and eventually form up into sentry turrets.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Wand of Warding does very consistent damage, but requires some setup first.&quot;));

<span class="nc" id="L208">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new WandOfLivingEarth(),</span>
				&quot;This new wand has a lower damage output, but grants significant defensive power. The rocks the wand shoots at enemies reform around the hero and absorb damage. If enough rock is built, it will form up into a rock guardian which fights with the player.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;The Wand of Living Earth is lacking in offensive output, but does a great job of pulling focus and damage away from the player.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L212">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(Icons.get(Icons.LIBGDX), &quot;libGDX&quot;,</span>
				&quot;Large sections of Shattered's codebase is now using the multiplatform game library _libGDX._ Making the game's codebase less heavily tied to Android is a big step towards making the game available on other platforms!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Keyboard input handling and text rendering are still coupled to Android however. I will convert these game systems to use libGDX in a later update.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Note that Shattered will not immediately release on other platforms once libGDX conversion is complete, but it is a big step towards that.&quot;));

				&quot;The Warlock is intended to require a source of physical damage in addition to a wand to be successful. Upgradeable ally wands are problematic for warlock as you can get magical power and physical damage in one item, which makes his abilities absurdly useful with them. The warlock should synergize with allies, but I have scaled the amount down to more reasonable levels:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Soul mark healing increased to 40% of damage from 33%\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Soul mark is now 2/5 as effective when the damage-dealer isn't the hero.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;I'm also making a few smaller adjustments to other subclasses which are overperforming:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Berserker rate of rage loss over time increased by 33% (it is now 2/3 of what it was pre-0.7.3).\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ Released May 23rd, 2019\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 66 days after Shattered v0.7.2\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.7.3 was another variety update, focused on several incremental additions, improvements, buffs, and nerfs. This update came out relatively quickly as I wanted to respond to feedback from the enchantment changes in v0.7.2. Several of the new enchantments added in v0.7.2 were adjusted or replaced entirely, as I came up with better ideas for enchantments that weren't just damage boosts.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;There were also significant additions and improvements to alchemy and thrown weapons. Just like with enchantments, I was still working on finding the best balancing for many alchemy recipes. v0.7.3 helped, but more changes were needed to the system itself in future updates. One notable change was allowing players to create tipped darts anywhere, instead of having it by part of the alchemy system. This led to a huge increase to the usage of tipped darts.&quot;));

				&quot;Several changes have been made to enchantments, based on feedback from 0.7.2:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Precise and swift enchantments have been removed.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Lucky and blooming are now uncommon enchants, instead of rare and common.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Kinetic is a new common enchantment! This enchantment preserves excess damage when an enemy is killed and applies it to your next hit.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ Corrupting is a new rare enchantment! When killing an enemy, there is a chance you will corrupt it instead.&quot;));

				&quot;The alchemy guide has been adjusted due to the removal of dart tipping from alchemy. It now has 9 pages (down from 10), and the order of pages have been adjusted to put some simpler recipes earlier.&quot;));

				&quot;_-_ Tengu now throws his shurikens one at a time, just like other ranged enemies. The speed of the shurikens has been increased to compensate, so that the player doesn't need to keep waiting while Tengu's attacks are in flight.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ After the tengu boss battle, any extra items now drop in tengu's cell, instead of a random prison cell.\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;I made this change as too much of the warrior's power was put into his base class, and into a passive ability that players tend to ignore.

				&quot;_-_ Released Mar 18th, 2019\n&quot; +
				&quot;_-_ 90 days after Shattered v0.7.1\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.7.2 focused on a variety of smaller changes, but the most significant adjustments were to alchemy. Prior to this update a lot of the higher end alchemy recipes required very specific ingredients, so I introduced catalysts to make these recipes more flexible. While more work was still needed, this went a long way toward streamlining the most complex part of the alchemy system.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;This update also made some substantial design changes to enchantments. Since enchantments were more accessible after v0.7.0, I wanted to adjust them to be more about gameplay variety and less about raw damage. Prior to this update several of the most common enchantments were essentially direct increases to damage. Changing this was a good overall direction, but some of the specific changes in v0.7.2 missed the mark, and so I had to revisit enchantment mechanics shortly after.&quot;));
		
<span class="nc" id="L464">		changes.addButton( new ChangeButton(new ItemSprite(ItemSpriteSheet.BREW_UNSTABLE, null), &quot;Catalysts!&quot;,</span>

				&quot;These catalysts are made with any potion/scroll, and a seed/runestone. They replace many specific items for higher-cost recipes. Alchemy should be much more flexible now!\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Additional Alchemy Changes:\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;When a recipe asks for any item of a certain type that item no longer has to be identified.\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;_-_ 61 days after Shattered v0.7.0\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;v0.7.1 featured the last of Shattered's hero reworks, this time to the Huntress! I wanted to keep her theme of ranged combat, but expand on how her range could interact with the environment. This led to her being able to 'furrow' grass, which creates all sorts of interesting gameplay. Her primary ranged weapon was also changed to no longer be upgradeable, which was important to make her power more consistent, and her item builds more variable from run to run.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;I also finally made throwing weapons proper equipment in v0.7.1 by letting the player upgrade them! Upgraded thrown weapons are pretty niche, but its great to let the player invest in these items just like other pieces of equipment.&quot;));

				&quot;Her boomerang has been replaced with a bow. The bow has infinite uses, like the boomerang, but cannot be upgraded directly, instead it will grow stronger as the huntress levels up.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Her knuckledusters have been replaced with studded gloves. This change is purely cosmetic.\n\n&quot; +
				&quot;Those with runs in progress will have their boomerang turn into a bow, and will regain most of the scrolls of upgrade spent on the boomerang.\n\n&quot; +

				&quot;v0.7.0 was Shattered's second longest-developed update at almost 6 months! This update took so long because it included my first attempt at an entirely new gameplay system: item crafting via alchemy!\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Crafting was actually something I wanted to do for years but I kept ending up scrapping my plans because they were too complex. Finally I settled on a system that was aimed at giving consumable items new uses, and that didn't interact with equipment at all. Despite my best efforts the system still ended up not quite doing its job while also being too complex. I've ended up steadily improving the system over future updates.\n&quot; +
				&quot;\n&quot; +
				&quot;Also, before v0.7.0 there were a few unique artifacts which only dropped from particular enemies. I standardized these items in v0.7.0 to either be universal, or scrapped them entirely and put some of their functionality into other game systems.&quot;));
